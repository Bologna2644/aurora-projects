            <p/>A trick weapon devised by the workshop to hunt beasts, this saw-toothed blade is affixed to a handle by a hinge, enabling one to slash with it like an axe or like a halberd. <p/>
            <p><b>Trick Weapon.</b></p>
            <p>As a bonus action, you can flick the saw around from under the handle to lengthen its reach, or back again. While extended, the saw cleaver has the reach and two-handed properties. In addition, you have disadvantage on attacks made against targets within 5 feet of you while the saw cleaver is extended.</p>

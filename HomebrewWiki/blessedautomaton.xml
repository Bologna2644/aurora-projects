            <h4>Traits</h4>
            <p></p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Your Consitution score increases by 2</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> Blessed automatons are odd as far as constructs go, they age a bit. When they are created, they have the mindset of an impressionable child, reaching adulthood after about 2 years of experience with their clergy/cult. They can live indefinitely if they properly maintain their construction.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Alignment.</em></strong> Though blessed automatons tend towards the alignment of their creators, it is not impossible for them to go against their ordained purpose.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Blessed automatons tend to be the approximate size of their creators, meaning that they can stand anywhere between 4 feet and eight feet tall, and weigh between 120 and 400 pounds. Your size is Medium.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Darkvision.</em></strong> You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Living Construct.</em></strong> Even though you were constructed, you are a living creature. You are immune to diseases. You do not need to eat or breathe, but you can ingest food and drink if you wish. Instead of sleeping, you enter an inactive state for 4 hours each day. You do not dream in this state; you are fully aware of your surroundings and notice approaching enemies and other events as normal.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Unearthly Resolve.</em></strong> Blessed automatons have advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Divine Contruct.</em></strong> Your creature type is construct. However, you are affected by all healing except from healing provided by items such as a healing potion. Also, you have immunity to poison damage and the poisoned condition.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You can speak, read, and write Common and one other languages dependant on your subrace.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Subrace.</em></strong> Pick a subrace that best describes the nature of your automaton.</p>

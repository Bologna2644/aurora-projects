        <description>
            <p>Small, persistent little creatures. Slugcats dominate the ecosystem, their unique abilities and traits allowing them to run circles around larger predators and hunt smaller prey. These critters come in many forms; agressive hunters to aquatic life forms. They made their way through the world fashioning weapons out of anything they could get their paws on.</p>
            <p class="indent"></p>
            <h4>Traits</h4>
            <p></p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Your Dexterity score increases by 2, your Constitution decreases by 2</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Age.</em></strong>Slugcats age rather quickly, often reaching adulthood in just 5 years or so. </p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Alignment.</em></strong> Slugcats don't tend to have any particular alignment but may be considered chaotic.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Small</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet. You can climb and swim 15ft</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You can write Common and use your paws to gesture at creatures</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Subrace.</em></strong> Pick a subrace that best describes the nature of your Slugcat.</p>
            <h4>Resourceful Scavenger</h4> 
            <p class="indent">All slugcats have a keen sense for scavenging. Small objects can be fashioned into spears and food can be fashioned into rations.</p>
            <p class="indent"><i>Scavenger</i></p>
            <p class="indent">Slugcat's have proficiency in Investigation and Survival Checks, due to their time spent living off of scraps. Rations will provide one food pip dependent on the slugcat, and spears can be held if there is a hand free. In combat, the scavenge action can be taken to find a spear.</p>
            <p class="indent"><i>Untrained</i></p>
            <p class="indent">One Consequence of a Slugcat's animal behaviour is that they are not well trained with weaponry. They can learn to use a weapon, but won't be proficient in anything but spear/grenade throwing. Any weapon with the Heavy property will force the slugcat to roll with disadvantage to hit, and two handed weapons prevent the scavenging and use of spears in combat. Most slugcats can store one spear each, with exceptions.</p>
            <h4>The Spear</h4>
            <p class="indent">The Spear is arguably the most important part of a slugcat's arsenal. It has a range of 35ft, can be extended with any ranged weapon extensions, and deals a base damage of 1d10 piercing damage. This damage increases by 1d10 at level 3,5,8,13,15 and by 2d10 at level 18.</p>
            <h4>Karma Cycle</h4>
            <p class="indent">Food pips have two uses; combat and karma.</p>
            <p class="indent">When the slugcat longrests with a full set of food pips, their karma level will increase by 1, to a maximum of 5. If they long rest without full food pip, the karma decreases by 1.</p>
            <p class="indent"><i>Violence</i></p>
            <p class="indent">The slugcat experiences no effects.</p>
            <p class="indent"><i>Lust</i></p>
            <p class="indent">The Slugcat becomes proficient in Performance</p>
            <p class="indent"><i>Compainionship</i></p>
            <p class="indent">The Slugcat becomes proficient in Animal Handling</p>
            <p class="indent"><i>Gluttony</i></p>
            <p class="indent">The Slugcat becomes proficient in Sleight of Hand</p>
            <p class="indent"><i>Survival</i></p>
            <p class="indent">The Slugcat becomes an expert in Survival</p>
            <h4>Mean Appetite</h4>
            <p class="indent">Food pips are the core of a slugcats survival. With food pips, the slugcat is capable of improving their combat effectiveness. </p>
            <p class="indent">Every slugcat has a max of 5 pips to use, and pips are filled with rations typically or other foodstuffs to the GM's consideration. </p>
            <p class="indent">Each slugcat has actions they can take with the food pips; </p>
            <p class="indent"><i>Slugcat Restoration </i></p>
            <p class="indent">Use your bonus action to consume 1  food pip to restore 1d4 HP, is increased to 2d4 at level 7 and 4d4 at level 13. </p>
            <p class="indent"><i>Slugcat Rage </i></p>
            <p class="indent">Use your bonus action to consume 1 food pip and until the end of your turn have +2 to hit and damage. </p>
            <p class="indent"><i>Slugcat Agility </i></p>
            <p class="indent">Use your action to consume 2 food pips and, until the end of your turn, double your movement speed. </p>

# Slugcat
The Slugcat race is based off the slugcat characters from RAINWORLD. This Race is much more involved than the Homebrew Wiki 5e race, which some people might prefer. This is my first race so the balancing may be off, but I plan to update the race accordingly.

The Core idea of this race is centering player interactions in combat on the use of spears and food pips. I tried my best to implement the features of Rainworld in the least frustrating manner.


## Survivors in a Wasteland

*A white blur vanishes in a tangle of bushes, a red warrior mauls at its dinner, a green shape descends down a cliff by its tongue. Slugcats have been seen with a variety of mutations and colours, but all are nimble and experienced members of their ecosystem, using the environment to make it to the next shelter*

Slugcat's have proficiency in Investigation and Survival Checks, due to their time spent living off of scraps. Rations will provide one food pip dependent on the slugcat, and spears can be held if there is a hand free. In combat, the scavenge action can be taken to find a spear.<br>

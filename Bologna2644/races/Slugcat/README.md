# Slugcat
The Slugcat race is based off the slugcat characters from RAINWORLD. This Race is much more involved than the Homebrew Wiki 5e race, which some people might prefer. This is my first race so the balancing may be off, but I plan to update the race accordingly.

The Core idea of this race is centering player interactions in combat on the use of spears and food pips. I tried my best to implement the features of Rainworld in the least frustrating manner.


## Survivors in a Wasteland

*A white blur vanishes in a tangle of bushes, a red warrior mauls at its dinner, a green shape descends down a cliff by its tongue. Slugcats have been seen with a variety of mutations and colours, but all are nimble and experienced members of their ecosystem, using the environment to make it to the next shelter*

## Peace among Worlds

Slugcats are intelligent creatures, so much so they can understand and form companionship across species. They have been known to tame beasts with scavenged food, or make allies with other intelligent species.

## Racial Traits

### *Resourceful Scavenger*

All slugcats have a keen sense for scavenging. Small objects can be fashioned into spears and food can be fashioned into rations.<br>
<br>
*Scavenger*<br>
Slugcat's have proficiency in Investigation and Survival Checks, due to their time spent living off of scraps. Rations will provide one food pip dependent on the slugcat, and spears can be held if there is a hand free. In combat, the scavenge action can be taken to find a spear.<br>
<br>
*Untrained*<br>
One Consequence of a Slugcat's animal behaviour is that they are not well trained with weaponry. They can learn to use a weapon, but won't be proficient in anything but spear/grenade throwing. Any weapon with the Heavy property will force the slugcat to roll with disadvantage to hit, and two handed weapons prevent the scavenging and use of spears in combat. Most slugcats can store one spear each, with exceptions.<br>
<br>
*The Spear*<br>
The Spear is arguably the most important part of a slugcat's arsenal. It has a range of 35ft, can be extended with any ranged weapon extensions, and deals a base damage of 1d10 piercing damage. This damage increases by 1d10 at level 3,5,8,13,15 and by 2d10 at level 18.<br>

### *Mean Appetite*

Food pips are the core of a slugcats survival. With food pips, the slugcat is capable of improving their combat effectiveness.<br>
Every slugcat has a max of 5 pips to use, and pips are filled with rations typically or other foodstuffs to the GM's consideration.<br>
Each slugcat has actions they can take with the food pips;<br>
>Food Pip Actions
>>*Slugcat Restoration* ; Use your bonus action to consume 1  food pip to restore 1d4 HP, is increased to 2d4 at level 7 and 4d4 at level 13.<br>
>>*Slugcat Rage* ; Use your bonus action to consume 1 food pip and until the end of your turn have +2 to hit and damage.<br>
>>*Slugcat Agility* ; Use your bonus action to consume 2 food pips and, until the end of your turn, double your movement speed.<br>

### *Karma Cycle*

When the slugcat longrests with a full set of food pips, their karma level will increase by 1, to a maximum of 5. If they long rest without full food pips, their karma decreases by 1.<br>
The Slugcat cannit have negative karma. Violence is Level 0.<br>
